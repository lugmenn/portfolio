## DATA EXTRACTION FROM DATABASE FOR ANALYSIS 

For this project, I used MySQL to extract data from a database that included some properties' records from Watershed Properties used as long\-term rentals, regarding their location and building characteristics, as well as yearly profits and occupancy rate. Another table included records from some other properties used as short term rentals, including their characteristics and rates per night.

Through SQL queries, the data was transformed in order to be merged into a single table and select the short\-term rentals with similar characteristics as the ones on the list of long\-term rentals from Watershed, having both the yearly profits and the estimate rates per night needed to complete the analysis and the profits' estimates needed to decide which properties would increase total profits if they were to be converted into shot term rentals. This analysis was completed on Excel \(you can [read more here](https://www.datascienceportfol.io/lugmenn/projects/0)\).

These are some of the queries ran on MySQL to complete the data extraction and part of its transformation.

EXPLORING THE AVAILABLE DATA

Reviewed each of the tables' fields contained in them.

```sql
SHOW columns FROM capstone.location;

SHOW columns FROM capstone.property_type;

SHOW columns FROM capstone.st_property_info;

SHOW columns FROM capstone.st_rental_dates;

SHOW columns FROM capstone.st_rental_prices;

SHOW columns FROM capstone.watershed_property_info;
```


I explored the structure of the data contained in each of the tables in order to know if data needed to be cleaned and transformed. Additionally, I reviewd if there were any NULL Values in


```sql
SELECT * 
FROM capstone.location
LIMIT 50;

#-- REVIEW IF THERE AREN'T ANY NULL VALUES IN 'state', AND SUMMARIZE HOW MANY RECORDS EACH ONE OF THEM HAS
SELECT DISTINCT 
		state,
		COUNT(location_id) as Number_of_records
FROM capstone.location
GROUP BY state;

SELECT * 
FROM capstone.property_type;

SELECT * 
FROM capstone.st_property_info
LIMIT 50;

SELECT * 
FROM capstone.st_rental_dates
LIMIT 50;

SELECT * 
FROM capstone.st_rental_prices
LIMIT 50;

SELECT * 
FROM capstone.watershed_property_info;

```
