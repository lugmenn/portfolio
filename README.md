Welcome to my portfolio :)

## 1. Change in profits in the real estate industry
Rough estimate in the changes of profits for converting certain long-term rental properties into the short-term rental market. The approximate change in profit analysis took into account the properties' location and their expected occupancy rates throughout the year. First, [data had to be extracted using SQL queries](2024_03_watershed_database).

## 2. Smart devices' use
This is a [test](Fitbit_Analysis.ipynb)


More coming soon.
