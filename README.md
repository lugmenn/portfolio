# Data Analysis

Hello! In this page I present some of the data analysis projects I've completed using a variety of tools, such as Microsoft Excel, MySQL, Tableau, PowerBI and Python.

## 1. Change in profits in the real estate industry
Rough estimate in the changes of profits for converting certain long-term rental properties into the short-term rental market. The approximate change in profit analysis took into account the properties' location and their expected occupancy rates throughout the year. First, [data had to be extracted using SQL queries](2024_03_watershed_database).

## 2. Improving the Bellabeat devices and their user engagement
Shared insights and recommended business actions based on the analysis of activity data recorded by 33 users of FitBit devices during two months as a way of finding growth opportunities in Bellabeat's products for health improvement and some possible roads to increase user engamement. [Analysis done on Python](2024_06_bellabeat_analysis.md).
